# COVID-19 Python Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a python script (Jupyter Notebook) to create a machine learning model of COVID-19 deaths based on Google's Community Mobility Reports

The model relies on the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and [Google's Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) 

The .csv files in this repository are copies from those two sources from 2020-05-12 to replicate the results shown in the model
